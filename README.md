## Overview

Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Summary

A successful bike sharing project needs several conditions, which were diplayed above. The first is that this area should have large amount of tourist or job oppotunities. Then, the second one is that there is a concentrated big city, here like New York City. People can use bike to across whole city. Therefore, for Des Moines, the first condition should be considered is the size of Des Moines, not only the land size but also the population. The second condition should be considered is tourism situation and job oppotunities.

## Further research

The age of customers by gender, which will provide the focused part of customers.
The population of Des Moines for each commmunity, which can provide the basic evidence supporting the bike sharing project.
The bike stops of New York City, which will display the density of bike stops.
